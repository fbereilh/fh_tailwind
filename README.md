The FastHTML Tailwind package 🛠️ simplifies setting up Tailwind CSS 🎨
and DaisyUI 🌼 in FastHTML projects. It allows for the seamless
integration of Tailwind styling ✨ and custom themes 🎨 without relying
on external CDNs 🌐. This package is designed specifically for
developers 👨‍💻👩‍💻 using FastHTML who want to leverage the power of
Tailwind CSS 💪 and DaisyUI to create visually stunning 🌟, highly
customizable websites 🌍 efficiently.

## ✨ Key Features of FastHTML Tailwind Integration

🗂️ Project Structure Creation: Automatically sets up the necessary
folder structure 📂 for a new FastHTML project, making it easy to get
started 🚀.

⚙️ Tailwind and DaisyUI Setup: Installs and configures specific versions
of Tailwind CSS (v3.4.13) and DaisyUI (v4.12.13) locally, ensuring
consistent project behavior 🔄.

🔍 Dynamic Class Extraction: Extracts Tailwind CSS classes from Python
files 🐍 and generates a Tailwind configuration that includes those
classes.

🎨 Custom Themes: Configures DaisyUI with a custom theme to be used
throughout your project.

🧪 Automated Testing: Includes automated tests ✅ to ensure the correct
project structure and CSS compilation.


    ## 🛠️ Installation of FastHTML Tailwind

    Ensure that Node.js is installed before proceeding.

    To install the FastHTML Tailwind package, follow these steps:

    📥 Install the package using pip:

    ```sh
    $ pip install fh_tailwind

## 🚀 How to Use the FastHTML Tailwind Package

To set up Tailwind in your project, use the following command to
initialize everything:

``` sh
$ fh_tailwind_setup
```

This command will configure Tailwind and DaisyUI in your project,
creating all necessary files and folders (public and node). Note that
the node folder will contain a node_modules directory, which should be
added to your .gitignore file to avoid committing unnecessary
dependencies.

Once everything is set up, add update_styles to the on_startup parameter
of your FastHTML app. This function extracts all cls attributes from
your Python components, ensuring that Tailwind CSS generates the
necessary styles:

🐍 Scans all Python files in your project.

📄 Extracts the classes used and creates an HTML file for Tailwind to
scan.

🖌️ Generates styles.css from the input Tailwind file.

## 📋 Example: FastHTML with Tailwind and DaisyUI

To start using the package in your project:

``` python
from fh_tailwind import update_styles
from fasthtml.common import Link, fast_app, serve, Div, P

hdrs = [Link(rel="stylesheet", href="public/styles.css", type="text/css")]
app, rt = fast_app(
    live=True,  # 🔴 Enable live updates
    pico=False,  # 🚫 Disable PicoCSS to use Tailwind instead
    on_startup=[update_styles],  # 🔄 Run update_styles during startup
    hdrs=hdrs,
    htmlkw={"data-theme": "mytheme"},
)

@rt("/")
def get():
    return Div(cls="flex items-center justify-center h-96")(
        P(cls="text-6xl text-center font-bold")(
            "Hello, Tailwind and DaisyUI with mytheme is applied!")
        )

serve()
```
